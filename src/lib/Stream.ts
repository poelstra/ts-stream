	 * The `reader` callback is never called while its previously returned

	 * called after all reads have completed.
	 *
	 * The corresponding `write()` or `end()` operation is blocked until the
	 * value returned from the reader or ender callback is resolved. If the
	 * callback throws an error or the returned promise resolves to a rejection,
	 * the `write()` or `end()` will be rejected with it.
	 *
	 * All callbacks are always called asynchronously (i.e. some time after

	 *
	 * `aborter` is called once if the stream is aborted and has not ended yet.

	 * pending, to allow early termination, but it will no longer be called
	 * if its promise has resolved).
	 *
	 * The `aborter` callback can be called while a reader callback's promise is
	 * still pending, and should try to let `reader` or `ender` finish as fast
	 * as possible.
	 *
	 * Note that even when a stream is aborted, it still needs to be `end()`'ed
	 * correctly.
	 *
	 * If no `ender` is given, a default end handler is installed that directly

	 * The `aborter` callback can be called while a reader callback's promise is
	 * still pending, and should try to let `reader` or `ender` finish as fast
	 * as possible.
	 *
	 * Note that even when a stream is aborted, it still needs to be `end()`'ed
	 * correctly.
	 *
	 * If no `ender` is given, a default end handler is installed that directly
